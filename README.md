Open source of EPiServer.Forms.Samples package, compatibles with Forms 4.x API.


Roadmap
-------------

More features will be added over time.
Features here are tested before pushing.

This is not intended to be a starter solution but provides the ability to showcase a number of features that may be needed for developing Forms extensions.
This package contains extra Form Elements, which required more dependency on complex JS libraries.

We will push code here after every release.
From 2017, we only maintain the source-code here without building the package.


Creating nuget packages in local
-------------

To set up a development environment, run:

```
build.cmd
```
then run
```
pack.cmd
```

This task will create nuget packages then put them into nupkgs folder


Release note
-------------
v4.1.0
 - Refactor structure of the repo
 - Bugfixes
   
v3.3.1
 - Bugfixes

v3.3.0

- EPiServerForm 4.3 improves the way resources (scripts, CSS) are loaded. If a form element needs its own resource, it must implement the IElementRequireClientResources interface. 
- The Forms element resources are loaded after Forms and external resources. 
- For example, the DateTime element requires jquery daytime to work but it is not loaded until the element is dragged into the form.
